# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (facilitated by Project Manager or Scrum Master)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (led by Product Manager, with input from UX Designer and Developers)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points, involving Developers and relevant SMEs)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) (collaborative across team, including QA and Data Analyst for metrics)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points (coordinated by Project Manager)
6. Create release plan and milestone map (Project Manager with Product Manager alignment)
